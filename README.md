# LaTeX class for Informatics theses
This LaTeX class provide a document class for typesetting Informatics dissertations. It is a fork of `infthesis.cls` as found on Informatics DICE machines, however I have patched the class in various ways to make it more flexible.

## Dependencies
The document class requires the following packages:
 * ifthen
 * graphics
 * xspace
 * eushield
 
where *eushield* is the only nonstandard LaTeX package. The package provides various versions of the university's crest. The [eushield][eushield.sty] package is not distributed along with this class. 

You can obtain a copy of it via [Informatics DReaM](http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/projects/polyml/application/cover-letter/tex/logos/eushield.sty). You must also obtain the following necessary copies of the university crest:
* eushield-normal.[[pdf](http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/projects/polyml/application/cover-letter/tex/logos/eushield-normal.pdf)][[ps](http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/projects/polyml/application/cover-letter/tex/logos/eushield-normal.ps)]
* eushield-noback.[[pdf](http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/projects/polyml/application/cover-letter/tex/logos/eushield-noback.pdf)][[ps](http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/projects/polyml/application/cover-letter/tex/logos/eushield-noback.ps)]
* eushield-reversed.[[pdf](http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/projects/polyml/application/cover-letter/tex/logos/eushield-reversed.pdf)][[ps](http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/projects/polyml/application/cover-letter/tex/logos/eushield-reversed.ps)]
* eushield-twocolour.[[pdf](http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/projects/polyml/application/cover-letter/tex/logos/eushield-twocolour.pdf)][[ps](http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/projects/polyml/application/cover-letter/tex/logos/eushield-twocolour.ps)]
* eushield-fullcolour.[[pdf](http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/projects/polyml/application/cover-letter/tex/logos/eushield-fullcolour.pdf)][[ps](http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/projects/polyml/application/cover-letter/tex/logos/eushield-fullcolour.ps)]
